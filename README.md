DC Register Unofficial Open Data
================================

This is a repository of open data for the District of Columbia Register, the DC government's collection of administrative issuances, October 2009-present, from https://dcregs.dc.gov/default.aspx. Why? Because the DC website provides a hopelessly bad interface for actually finding anything.

The notices in the Register have been converted into browser and search engine friendly formats using ocrmypdf and tesseract (for PDFs) and LibreOffice (for Word docs).

	apt-get install ocrmypdf
	pip3 install rtyaml tqdm python-magic
